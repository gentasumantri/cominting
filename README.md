# co-Minter

## Summary

co-Minter is a smart contract-based application designed to accommodate the minting process and revenue sharing of NFTs involving collaborations between multiple parties. The application aims to facilitate artists and creators in creating, publishing, and selling their NFT works without having to involve intermediaries or traditional publishers. co-Minter enables artists and creators to automatically distribute royalties from the sale of NFTs to all parties involved in the collaboration, providing higher transparency and efficiency.

## Background

In the growing world of NFTs, many artists and creators collaborate with intermediaries to manage the publishing, sales, and promotion of their works. However, the current revenue sharing system still relies on manual and traditional methods, which are often less efficient and transparent. co-Minter addresses this issue by providing a platform that simplifies collaboration and revenue sharing for various parties involved in the creation of NFTs.

## Key Features

1.  **co-Minting**: Support for the minting process of NFTs resulting from collaborations between multiple parties, such as artists, music creators, and band members.

2.  **Automatic Royalty Distribution**: An automatic and transparent revenue sharing system, ensuring that all parties involved in the collaboration receive their share according to the agreement.

3.  **Transparency**: By using smart contracts, co-Minter guarantees transparency in the minting, sales, and revenue sharing processes of NFTs.

4.  **Ease of Use**: co-Minter is designed with a user-friendly interface, making it easy for artists and creators to use the platform without having to possess deep technical knowledge of blockchain or NFT technology.

## How It Works

1. Artists or creators who want to create NFTs in collaboration with others register and access the co-Minter platform.

2. They will then create a smart contract that includes revenue sharing agreements and information about the parties involved in the collaboration.

3. Once the contract is created, the NFT will be minted through the co-Minter platform.

4. The NFT can then be marketed and sold through compatible NFT platforms.

5. Whenever the NFT is sold or traded, royalties will be automatically distributed to all parties involved according to the agreement in the smart contract.

With co-Minter, collaboration between artists and creators in creating NFTs becomes easier, more transparent, and more efficient. This application helps reduce reliance on intermediaries and ensures fair royalty distribution for all parties involved in the creative process.

1. Access to a Web3-supporting web browser, such as Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox with the Metamask extension, or a blockchain-based browser like Brave.

2. A compatible cryptocurrency wallet account (e.g., Metamask, Trust Wallet, or Coinbase Wallet).

3. A balance in supported cryptocurrencies (e.g., Ethereum) to pay for transaction fees and NFT minting.

## User Guide

4. Upload the content to be used as the NFT, such as image, video, or audio files.

5. Add information about the parties involved in the collaboration, such as wallet addresses and agreed-upon revenue sharing percentages.

6. Create a smart contract that includes revenue sharing agreement information and involved parties.

7. Confirm and mint the NFT through the co-Minter platform.

8. The minted NFT will appear in your wallet account and be ready for marketing on compatible NFT platforms.
